# Single-page application patterns

Use this reference when a feature adds SWR, TanStack Query, or another browser data cache. Start with the Next.js [client-side data fetching guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/client-side-data-fetching), then use its library-specific [TanStack Query](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/client-side-data-fetching/tanstack-query) or [SWR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/client-side-data-fetching/swr) guide for runnable examples and framework integration details.

## Decide whether a client cache is needed

Use a client data library when the browser needs revalidation, optimistic mutations, request deduplication, or shared live data. If a Client Component only reads server data once, pass a Promise from its Server Component and unwrap it with `use()` instead.

## Keep ownership with the feature

```text
features/<domain>/
  <domain>-cache.ts          # Pure server tags + client keys
  <domain>-queries.ts        # Server reads and cacheLife
  <domain>-query-options.ts  # Client fetcher/query options
  hooks/use-*.ts             # Client mutations and coordination
  components/                # Async server owner + client leaves
```

The cache contract imports neither Next.js nor the client library. Queries, actions, route handlers, hydration code, query options, and hooks import identities from it. This prevents a key or tag spelling from drifting between a read and its invalidation.

Keep behavior in the layer that owns it:

- Server `cacheLife`, `cacheTag`, and database reads belong in `<domain>-queries.ts`.
- Browser freshness and refetch behavior belong in `<domain>-query-options.ts` or the SWR hook.
- Optimistic mutation behavior belongs in `hooks/use-*.ts`.
- Tiny effect-only or interactive leaves belong in `components/`.

## Seed from the server

The async feature component owns the initial read and the library's hydration provider. The page remains a synchronous composition surface and owns the feature's Suspense boundary.

- With SWR, seed the exact key read by `useSWR`; follow the Next.js [SWR guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/client-side-data-fetching/swr) and the library's [Next.js guidance](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/with-nextjs).
- With TanStack Query, seed the same query key read by the client query; follow the Next.js [TanStack Query guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/client-side-data-fetching/tanstack-query) and the library's [Advanced Server Rendering guide](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/advanced-ssr).

Do not move the initial read to the browser just because the feature also has a client cache.

## Coordinate Cache Components

Use the Next.js [TanStack Query guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/client-side-data-fetching/tanstack-query) or [SWR guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/client-side-data-fetching/swr) as the source of truth for cache boundaries, sharing policy, lifetimes, tags, and hydration behavior. Do not reproduce that framework guidance in this skill.

The architecture rule here is ownership only: the async feature component owns the initial server seed and hydration provider, while the page owns the feature's Suspense boundary and loading sequence.

For personalized hydration that should be reused across server requests, also follow the trusted-identity boundary in `references/cache-components.md`.

## Mutate without drift

Let the client library own the optimistic browser update, rollback, and authoritative response. Let the write invalidate the server tag only after stored data changes. Do not add polling as a cache-coordination mechanism; add focus revalidation, intervals, SSE, or WebSockets only when the product actually needs external updates to appear automatically.
